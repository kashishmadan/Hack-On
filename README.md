# dhanyawad

A market place that leverages the resources of a community and allows people to connect and support each other via skill exchange.
As we know COVID-19 has tremendously changed and affected everyone's lifestyle. It has become harder for many especially for those in high-risk groups to get daily necessities or even to have some social time with neighbors or acquaintances. We stand to create a platform that solves this problem.
Abiding by the rules of social distancing and incentivizing community members to help others and to also support local businesses affected by the shutdown. Users register themselves and verify their identity using social media platforms. Then they can request and complete favors. On completing favors you are awarded gratitude points. You can buy gifts from local businesses to support them.
While completing a favor we protect you by mapping a minimum distance using Augmented Reality to ensure that you abide by the rules of social distancing. 
Do a favor get gratitude points and share with friends to motivate them as well! ðŸŒŸ
